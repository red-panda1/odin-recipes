        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The Rainbow Bar and Grill in L.A. was known for its lentil soup.
        </p>
        <p>
            A very drunk John Belushi stopped in there on the night of March 5, 1982.
        </p>
        <p>
            Belushi scarfed down a bowl of the lentil soup in the Rainbow's kitchen,
             then returned to his bungalow at Chateau Marmont. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That night, Belushi's girlfriend injected the 33-year-old
             comedian with what turned out to be a lethal dose of heroin and cocaine.
