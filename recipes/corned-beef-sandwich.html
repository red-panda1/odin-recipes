        <p>
            During the afternoon of December 8, 1980, Lennon ate a 
            <strong>corned beef sandwich</strong> before going to
             a New York recording studio to work on one of Yoko Ono's new singles.
        </p>
        <p>
            At around 10:30 p.m.,
             having just received the happy news that their album, Double Fantasy,
             had gone platinum, they decided to quit working for the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon returning to their Manhattan apartment a deranged fan 
            shot and killed Lennon.
